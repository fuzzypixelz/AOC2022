# Advent Of Code 2022: Stick-to-F# Edition

## Day 1

Here we go again :)

## Day 2

- It was interesting how the second question reduces to the first.
- I may have overdone it with the types.
- Still relatively easy.

## Day 3

- I wrote much less code today.
- I was surprised to see that the difference between the first and second
  questions is nothing more than the difference between _splitting_ rucksacks
  in half and _chunking_ rucksacks into groups of three.
- Why did F# remove Character Range Matches?

## Day 4

- F# interactive programming is very practical, could be faster.
- Not sure if using FParsec here is overkill.
- I got the `Assignment.AreOverlapping` function wrong many times.
